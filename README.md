# Laravel + React + Ant Design Boilerplate

Welcome! In this repository you will find an application boilerplate for:

* [Laravel 7](https://laravel.com/);
* [React 16.2](https://reactjs.org/);
* [And Design](https://ant.design/);

I made it because I am working a lot with it lately and I am a really, really lazy developer.

It uses [Laravel Vessel](https://vessel.shippingdocker.com/) under the hood to dockerize the entire development environment.

All you need to do is the following:

* clone the repo;
* start the environment with the _./vessel start_ command;
* copy the .env.example to .env file if necessary;
* run _./vessel yarn_ and then _./vessel yarn run dev_ to build the frontend app;

TODOS:

* [ ] add a way to customize color schemes easily;
